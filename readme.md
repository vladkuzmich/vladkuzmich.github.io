# BARB API SPECIFICATION

This repository contains a specification using [OpenAPI 3.03](https://swagger.io/specification/) of an API for accessing BARB panel data.

It includes the following:

  1. [A YAML file](specifications/open_api_spec.yaml) that gives the full specification of the web api.
  2. [A standalone html file](specifications/documentation/view_api.html) that will allow you to review the documentation
  3. [Additional notes](specifications/additional_notes.md) on the implementation of the API

To review the API

1. Open specifications/documentation/view_api.html in a browser. Note this may take a while to load the first time you open it
2. Review the specification. Note that for each endpoint you can toggle between the example data and the schema.
